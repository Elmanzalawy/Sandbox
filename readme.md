## Traits
>A trait is similar to a class, but it is only for grouping methods in a fine-grained and consistent way. PHP does not allow you to create an instance of a Trait like an instance of a class. And there is no such concept of an instance of a trait.

Inheritance allows classes to reuse the code vertically while the traits allow classes reuse the code horizontally.
