## PHP Data Types

PHP Supports the following data types:

- String
- Integer (non-decimal number between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647)
- Float
- Array
- Boolean
- Object
- Null
- Resource

The special resource type is not an actual data type. It is the storing of a reference to functions and resources external to PHP.

A common example of using the resource data type is a database call.

We will not talk about the resource type here, since it is an advanced topic.
