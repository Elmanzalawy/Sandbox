## Constructor
>Code executed when a class object is constructed, typically used to initialize the properties of an object.

## Destructor
>Unlike a constructor, a destructor doesnâ€™t accept any argument. The destructor is automatically invoked before an object is deleted. It happens when the object has no reference or when the script ends.
