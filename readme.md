## PHP Arrays
An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time.

In PHP, there are three types of arrays:

- **Indexed arrays** - Arrays with numeric index
- **Associative arrays** - Arrays with named keys
- **Multidimensional arrays** - Arrays containing one or more arrays
